With this web application, I've converted my Project Euler solutions stored on Github from a boring repository to a fresh and lively website. This projects highlights many web development tools available at my disposal, namely PHP, SQL, JavaScript, Ajax, jQuery, and Bootstrap.

Use the arrow buttons or the arrow keys to navigate and see rendered Python code come to life!
